                <p>Claire,</p>
                
                <p>I've been sitting here for an hour, watching the cursor blink on a blank screen, then remembering I'm using the old Royal Quiet De Luxe instead. Some habits die hard. The keys feel heavier tonight, each letter requiring intention in a way that typing never does.</p>
                
                <p>Your letter arrived Thursday. I've read it enough times that the creases are wearing thin where I fold it. You write about the gallery opening, the way the light caught that sculpture you've been working on for months. I can see it—the way your hands move when you're explaining something you care about, how you pause mid-sentence when you're searching for exactly the right word.</p>
                
                <p>Distance has a way of clarifying things, doesn't it? Not in the romantic comedy sense where everything becomes simple, but in the way that absence makes the small details impossibly vivid. I remember the sound your coffee cup makes against the saucer in the morning. I remember how you read with your index finger tracing the lines, unconsciously, like you're conducting the words.</p>
                
                <p>I'm not writing to say I miss you, though I do. I'm writing because I want you to know that loving someone doesn't always announce itself with <span class="x-out">grand gestures</span> <span class="overtype">certainty</span>. Sometimes it's quieter than that. Sometimes it's the realization that your thoughts have become conversations with someone who isn't there.</p>
                
                <p>The apartment feels different with your books gone from the shelf. Not empty, exactly, but <span class="typewriter-imperfection">reorganized</span> in a way that makes me notice what remains. Your copy of Neruda is still here—you left it deliberately, I think, marked at "Love Sonnet XVII." <em>I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where</em>. Subtle as a brick through a window, but I appreciate the sentiment.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know what happens next. Geography is <span class="x-out">a problem</span> complicated, and we're both stubborn enough to make this harder than it needs to be. But I wanted you to know that some Tuesday at 4 AM, someone was thinking about the way you laugh at your own jokes before you finish telling them, and the way you hold books like they might try to escape.</p>
                
                <p>Take care of yourself, Claire. Send more letters if you feel like it. I'll be here, making coffee for two out of habit and reading books you recommended.</p>
